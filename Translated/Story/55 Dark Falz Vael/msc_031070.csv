msc_031070_0030#0,"""We thought it was all over for you."""
msc_031070_0040#0,"""What exactly happened after the fight, anyway?"""
msc_031070_0050#0,"""I think... Zephetto saved me."""
msc_031070_0060#0,"""I'm still not really sure myself."""
msc_031070_0070#0,"""Zephetto?"""
msc_031070_0080#0,"""O-Oh, I see..."""
msc_031070_0090#0,"""...Well, that was quite the taxing battle after all."""
msc_031070_0100#0,"""I'm sure your mind must still be<br>all over the place in the aftermath."""
msc_031070_0110#0,"""Perhaps things will be clearer once<br>you've had the chance to rest."""
msc_031070_0120#0,"""How's the situation here?"""
msc_031070_0130#0,"""Is the fight with the Starless<br>going alright?"""
msc_031070_0140#0,"""Ah yes, we've been successful in<br>warding off the Starless' advances."""
msc_031070_0150#0,"""Thanks in no small part to the widespread<br>cooperation of the ARKS, might I add."""
msc_031070_0160#0,"""Indeed. We've repelled their assault<br>without any major issues."""
msc_031070_0170#0,"""Thanks in no small part to the widespread<br>cooperation of the ARKS, might I add."""
msc_031070_0180#0,"""Because of them, we were able to<br>focus completely on supporting you."""

msc_031070_0240#0,"""Does this mean...<br>we're done fighting the Starless?"""
msc_031070_0250#0,"""Well..."""
msc_031070_0260#0,"""Unfortunately, we're not out of<br>the cosmic woods just yet."""
msc_031070_0270#0,"""According to Zephetto, Vael was<br>essentially the leader of the Starless."""
msc_031070_0280#0,"""And from everything we've seen,<br>that much appears true."""

msc_031070_0330#0,"""...So the fighting just won't end."""
msc_031070_0340#0,"""I'll find a way."""
msc_031070_0350#0,"""So long as we fight together, we'll win."""
